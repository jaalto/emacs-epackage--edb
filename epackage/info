Description: flexible and customizable database
 EDB is a database program for GNU Emacs.  It permits you to manipulate
 structured (or not-so-structured) data within Emacs and provides many of
 the usual database features, including:
 .
    * Flexible, customizable file layouts.  Data may contain any
      character, including those used to delimit fields and records.
      Files read and written by the database may have arbitrary formats.
 .
    * Typed fields (e.g. integer, date, string); fields may also be
      subject to additional constraints (prime number, date before
      today, string that appears in some other record, etc.).
 .
    * Arbitrary data display formats for viewing records.  Multiple
      display formats can be open on a database simultaneously, viewing
      the same or different records.  The data display format can be
      automatically chosen based on the record's field values.
 .
    * Selective display of only those records of interest; others become
      temporarily invisible.
 .
    * Standard GNU Emacs editing commands, which work only within data
      fields and not on the surrounding text.
 .
    * Database summaries, which show in a single buffer one or more
      lines of information about each record.
 .
    * Sorting, with an easy-to-use interface for defining the sorting
      criteria; most sorting orders you would care about are easy to
      specify, but arbitrary ones are also permitted.
 .
    * Merging and reconciliation of databases.
 .
    * Reports generated from database information.
 .
    * Highly customizable via the underlying programming language, Emacs
      Lisp; many hooks and useful variables are provided to make this
      even easier.
 .
 EDB is more ambitious -- and therefore more complex -- than its
 forerunners (such as Forms Mode by Johan Vromans <jv@mh.nl>).  While
 other packages don't provide as much functionality as EDB, they may be
 more appropriate for simple needs.
 .
 While EDB provides sophisticated functionality and is extensively
 customizable, it is not as powerful as some other database systems, and
 does not directly qualify as either "relational" or "object-oriented."
 On the other hand, EDB may well meet your needs without being
 buzzword-compliant.  (EDB extensions to provide a subset of the
 features of a relational or object-oriented database can and have been
 written.)
